<!-- Published properties can be used to define an element’s “public API”. Polymer establishes two-way data
     binding for published properties and provides access to the property’s value using {{}}. -->

<!-- Publish a property by listing it in the attributes attribute in your <polymer-element>. Properties declared
     this way are initially null. To provide a more appropriate default value, include the same property name
     directly in your prototype. -->

<!-- The following example defines two data-bound properties on the element, owner and color, and gives them
     default values: -->
<polymer-element name="color-picker"
                 attributes="owner color">
    <template>
        This is a <strong>{{owner}}</strong>'s color-picker.
        He likes the color <b style="color: {{color}}">{{color}}</b>.
    </template>
    <script>
        Polymer({
                    // These default values are overridden
                    // by the user's attribute values.
                    color: "blue",
                    owner: "Chase"
                });
    </script>
</polymer-element>
