<!-- The use of the id attribute has traditionally been discouraged as an anti-pattern because the document
     requires element IDs to be unique. Shadow DOM, on the other hand, is a self-contained document-like
     subtree; IDs in that subtree do not interact with IDs in other trees. This means the use of IDs in
     Shadow DOM is not only permissible, it’s actually encouraged. Each Polymer element generates a map
     of IDs to node references in the element’s template. This map is accessible as $ on the element and
     can be used to quickly select the node you wish to work with. -->
