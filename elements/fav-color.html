<!-- You can use binding expressions in most HTML markup, except for tag names themselves. In the following
     example, we create a new property on our component named color whose value is bound to the value of the
     color style applied to the custom element. Bindings ensure that any time a property like color is changed,
     the new value will be propagated to all binding points. -->
