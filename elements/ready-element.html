<!-- Lifecycle callbacks are special methods you can define on your element which fire when the element goes
     through important transitions.-->

<!-- When a custom element has been registered it calls its created() callback (if one has been defined).
     When Polymer finishes its initialization, the ready() method is called. The ready callback is a great
     place to do constructor-like initialization work.-->
